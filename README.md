What I learned: <br>
This project help solidify my understanding of the addEventListener() method and switch statement implementation. It also introduced me to the target event property and how it can be referenced within an event listener. When I ran into difficulty trying to perform continous calculations, implemeting the target event property helped to resolve those issues.
